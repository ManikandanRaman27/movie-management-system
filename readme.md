# Movie Management System

Create a program that allows the user to manage a movie. The program
should allow the user to add, edit, delete, and search for movies. Each movie should have attributes such as title, release year,director, and genre. 

The program should store the movie data in a file for persistence. Additionally, the program could include features such as:
- Sorting and filtering movies by various criteria, such as title, release year, and genre.
- Displaying movie information, such as cast and plot summary.
- Generating recommendations based on the user's viewing history or preferences.
- Providing an interface for the user to rate and review movies.
- Supporting multiple users with individual movie libraries
